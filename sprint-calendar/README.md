# Sprint Calendar

This adds a calendar for the active sprint at the top of my journal pages.

My work journal files are stored with the following structure: `work/journal/{year}/{month}/{year}-{month}-{date}` for example `work/journal/2025/03/2025-03-20`.

Each journal file has some frontmatter added to set the type as journal i.e. `[type:journal]` and this is relevant, because in the widget, it's specified in the hook frontmatter tag that it'll only show at the top of any pages with a type of "journal".
