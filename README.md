# Silverbullet Stuff

This repo will contain some of the stuff that I've created for my Silverbullet instances at work or home.

[Silverbullet](https://silverbullet.md) is a pretty awesome note-taking tool, with a dev's mindset, created by Zef Hemel.

## Disclaimer
Some of the example data will include names. These names are entirely fictional and do not represent colleagues that I work with currently or in the past.

As of 13/09/25, the snippets I have in this repo are specifically for Silverbullet v1 and do not work on v2. I'll be working on these in the coming weeks/months to build compatible versions.
